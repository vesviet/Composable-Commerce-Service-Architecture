## 💎 Business Value

| Capability | What It Delivers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Full Commerce Flow** | Cart → checkout → payment → fulfillment → shipping → delivery with real-time status |
| **Multi-Gateway Payments** | Stripe, PayPal, VNPay, MoMo with fraud detection (GeoIP + VPN/proxy) |
| **Inventory Management** | Multi-warehouse stock tracking, reservations, low-stock alerts |
| **Multi-Carrier Shipping** | GHN, Grab with webhook tracking and automated label generation |
| **Returns & Exchanges** | Automated refund, restock, exchange order creation, shipping labels |
| **Loyalty & Rewards** | Points system, tier management, referrals, bonus campaigns |
| **Dynamic Pricing** | Rule-based pricing, promotions, coupons, BOGO, tiered discounts |
| **Real-Time Analytics** | Revenue, orders, fulfillment, shipping, customer cohort metrics (event-based) |
| **Intelligent Search** | Full-text + faceted search with Elasticsearch, autocomplete, analytics |
| **Enterprise Security** | JWT + OAuth2 + MFA, rate limiting, audit logging, PCI DSS compliance |

### Design Principles
- **Independent scaling** — each service scales separately (e.g., 10× Order during peak, 1× Analytics)
- **Fault isolation** — if Review crashes, customers still shop and pay
- **Zero-downtime deploys** — GitOps with ArgoCD, automated rollback
- **Event-driven** — services communicate via Dapr PubSub, transactional outbox guarantees delivery

## 🤔 Why Build This?

Off-the-shelf platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento) get you started fast — but hit walls at scale:

| Challenge | Off-the-Shelf | This Platform |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Vietnam payment gateways** (VNPay, MoMo) | Third-party plugins, unreliable | Native integration, circuit breaker, failover |
| **Multi-warehouse + WMS** | Basic or enterprise-only ($125K+/yr Magento) | Built-in: bin location, batch picking, stock reservation |
| **Peak traffic** (e.g., flash sale) | Scale entire monolith 10× | Scale only Order + Payment 10×, rest unchanged |
| **Transaction fees** | Shopify: 0.5–2% per transaction | $0 — no platform fees |
| **Data ownership** | Shopify holds your data | Self-hosted, full control |
| **Event reliability** | Webhooks can miss, hooks are synchronous | Transactional outbox + async PubSub + DLQ |

> **Bottom line**: This platform delivers what **Magento Enterprise charges $200K+/year** for — payment saga, event-driven architecture, multi-warehouse WMS, fraud detection — with **zero license fees** and **full source ownership**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.25+, Docker, PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+, kubectl

# 1. Clone & start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d postgres redis consul

# 2. Start services
tilt up

# 3. Access
#   Customer site:   http://localhost:3000
#   Admin dashboard: http://localhost:3001
#   API Gateway:     http://localhost:8000
#   Monitoring:      http://localhost:10350
```

```bash
# Per-service development
cd <service-name>
make build          # Build service
make run            # Run with hot reload
make test           # Run tests
make api            # Generate proto code
```

## 🏗️ Key Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose | Used By |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Transactional Outbox** | Reliable event publishing (DB + event in single transaction) | Order, Loyalty, Return, Fulfillment, Shipping |
| **Event Idempotency** | Deduplicate events with `event_idempotency` table | Warehouse, Search, Shipping, Loyalty |
| **Dead Letter Queue** | Failed event processing → DLQ for manual review | Order, Checkout, Payment, Search |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Prevent cascade failures on downstream service outages | Analytics (PG writes), Gateway |
| **Saga / Compensation** | Distributed transactions with rollback on failure | Checkout → Order → Payment → Warehouse |
| **CQRS** | Separate read/write paths for performance | Search (read-optimized Elasticsearch) |
