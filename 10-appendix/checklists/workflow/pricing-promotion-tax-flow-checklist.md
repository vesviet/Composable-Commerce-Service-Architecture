## 1. Data Consistency Between Services

### 1.1 Pricing Service

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `CreatePrice`/`UpdatePrice` use DB transaction + outbox in single TX | ✅ | `price_crud.go:203–252`, `254–309` |
| Cache invalidated **after** commit (not before) | ✅ | `price_crud.go:247–249`, `304–306` |
| 4-level price priority fallback (SKU+WH > SKU > Product+WH > Product) | ✅ | `GetPriceWithPriority` cascades correctly |
| `validatePrice` rejects `BasePrice ≤ 0`, negative SalePrice, SalePrice ≥ BasePrice | ✅ | `price_crud.go:544–567` |
| Outbox `GetPendingOutboxEvents` uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` | ✅ Fixed |
| `BulkCalculatePrice` partial failures signalled via `([]results, []errors)` | ✅ Fixed |
| Converted price cache key uses `productID+currency` (not stale record ID) | ✅ Fixed |
| Price rules sorted deterministically (priority + CreatedAt tiebreaker) | ✅ | `calculation.go:354–367` — `sort.SliceStable` with `CreatedAt` tiebreaker |
| Decimal arithmetic for price calculation (no float-based overflow) | ✅ | `calculation.go:223–226` — uses `shopspring/decimal` |

### Pricing Data Mismatch Risks

- [x] **[FIXED]** `promo_deleted_sub.go` handler implemented — orphan discounts cleaned up.
- [ ] **[V2-01] ⚠️ Stock consumer idempotency is in-memory only (`sync.Map`, 5-min TTL)** — `stock_consumer.go:31–52`. When the pricing worker pod restarts, `processedEvents` and `lastSeqMap` are reset. Dapr may re-deliver stock events → duplicate dynamic pricing triggers.
  - *Shopee/Lazada pattern*: Idempotency stored in Redis or PostgreSQL, not in-process memory.
  - **Fix**: Replace `sync.Map` with Redis `SET NX EX` per event ID.
- [x] **[V3-01] ✅ Fixed** — Added `promotion.deactivated` subscription to `promo_consumer.go:ConsumePromoEvents`, routed to `HandlePromotionDeleted`. Added `EventTypePromotionDeactivated` constant and DLQ topic.

### 1.2 Promotion Service

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `ApplyPromotion` idempotency: `FindByPromotionAndOrder` + DB unique constraint | ✅ | `promotion_usecase.go:94–104` |
| Campaign budget + usage reservation in same TX | ✅ | `promotion_usecase.go:122–131` |
| `ReleasePromotionUsage` decrements atomically in TX | ✅ | `promotion_usecase.go:200–254` |
| Per-customer usage limit enforced in `ValidatePromotions` | ✅ Fixed |
| Campaign deactivation emits per-promotion outbox events | ✅ | `campaign.go:83–101` |
| N+1 analytics queries eliminated (bulk stats) | ✅ | `usage_tracking.go:35–44` |
| Outbox max retry cap (migration 013 adds `max_retries INT DEFAULT 5`) | ✅ Fixed |
| `ConfirmPromotionUsage` idempotent (returns nil when rowsAffected==0) | ✅ | `promotion_usecase.go:190–193` |
| `ReleasePromotionUsage` idempotent (returns nil when rowsAffected==0) | ✅ | `promotion_usecase.go:216–219` |
| Coupon usage decremented on release (within TX) | ✅ | `promotion_usecase.go:222–228` |
| Release failure publishes alert event | ✅ | `promotion_usecase.go:251–253` |

### Promotion Data Mismatch Risks

- [x] **[V2-02] ✅ Fixed** — Changed `const maxRetries = 10` → `5` in `outbox_worker.go:119` to match DB `max_retries DEFAULT 5`.
- [x] **[V3-02] ✅ Fixed** — Aligned all `Topic*` and `EventType*` constants in `promotion/internal/constants/constants.go` to match actual outbox strings (e.g., `promotion.created` not `promotions.promotion.created`). `EventType*` now derives from `Topic*` constants.

---

## 2. Outbox / Saga / Retry Pattern

### 2.1 Pricing Service — Outbox

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Outbox worker implements `ContinuousWorker` | ✅ |
| Outbox registered in worker binary | ✅ |
| `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in `GetPendingOutboxEvents` | ✅ |
| Outbox cleanup: 7-day retention, 1000 batch limit | ✅ `biz/worker/outbox.go:92–99` |
| Poll interval: 5 seconds | ✅ `biz/worker/outbox.go:39` |
| Max retries: 5 (code matches DB) | ✅ `biz/worker/outbox.go:149` |
| Panic recovery in process loop | ✅ `biz/worker/outbox.go:82–87` |
| `GetBaseWorker()` returns `BaseContinuousWorker` | ✅ |

### 2.2 Promotion Service — Outbox

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Outbox worker processes 50 events per tick | ✅ `outbox_worker.go:77` |
| Outbox cleanup: processed events > 7 days purged | ✅ `outbox_worker.go:93–99` |
| `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in `FetchPendingEvents` | ✅ `data/outbox.go:64–70` |
| **Outbox worker initial run on start** | ✅ Fixed — `w.processEvents(ctx)` called before ticker loop |
| **`max_retries` alignment (code=5, DB=5)** | ✅ Fixed [V2-02] |
| **`StopChan()` in select loop** | ✅ Fixed [V3-P2-03] — now listens for both `ctx.Done()` and `w.StopChan()` |

### 2.3 Saga / Compensating Transactions

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Promotion apply → order cancel → `ReleasePromotionUsage` | ✅ `order_consumer.go:88–94` |
| Promotion confirm triggered by `order.delivered` or `order.completed` | ✅ `order_consumer.go:96–102` |
| Release failure publishes alert event (`promotion.release_failed`) | ✅ `promotion_usecase.go:258–267` |
| Price snapshot locked at checkout (pricing service responsibility?) | ⚠️ Pricing has no `SnapshotPrice`/`LockPriceForOrder` API. Checkout must persist price at order time. |

---

## 3. Event Publishing — Is It Actually Needed?

### 3.1 Pricing Service

| Event | Topic | Published | Consumers | Assessment |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| `price.updated` | `pricing.price.updated` | ✅ via outbox | Search, Catalog | ✅ Required |
| `price.deleted` | `pricing.price.deleted` | ✅ via outbox | Search | ✅ Required |
| `price.calculated` | `pricing.price.calculated` | ✅ direct publish (NOT via outbox) | Analytics | ⚠️ **Not durable** — direct Dapr publish via `eventHelper.PublishCustom`; if sidecar unavailable, event lost. Best-effort acceptable for analytics. |
| `discount.applied` | `pricing.discount.applied` | ❌ struct exists, never published | — | 🔵 Dead code — struct definition without any publish call |

### 3.2 Promotion Service

| Event | Published Via | Consumers | Assessment |
|-------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| `promotion.created` | ✅ outbox | Pricing (discount sync) | ✅ Required |
| `promotion.updated` | ✅ outbox | Pricing (discount sync) | ✅ Required |
| `promotion.deleted` | ✅ outbox | Pricing (discount sync) | ✅ Required |
| `promotion.deactivated` | ✅ outbox (campaign cascade) | **No consumer subscribed** | ❌ **[V3-01]** Pricing doesn't subscribe — discount mirror stale |
| `promotion.applied` | ✅ outbox | Loyalty (points), Analytics | ✅ Required |
| `promotion.usage_released` | ✅ outbox | Analytics | ✅ Required |
| `campaign.created/updated/activated/deactivated/deleted` | ✅ outbox | **No known consumer** | ⚠️ Outbox overhead; no documented consumer. Acceptable if analytics consumer planned. |

---

## 4. Event Subscription — Is It Actually Needed?

### 4.1 Pricing Service Subscriptions

| Event | Topic | Handler | Needed? |
|-------|-------|---------|---------| 
| `warehouse.stock.updated` | `warehouse.inventory.stock_changed` | `HandleStockUpdate` | ✅ Dynamic pricing on stock level |
| `warehouse.inventory.low_stock` | `warehouse.inventory.low_stock` | `HandleLowStock` | ✅ Flash pricing trigger on low stock |
| `promotion.created` | `promotion.created` | `HandlePromotionCreated` | ✅ Sync local discount mirror |
| `promotion.updated` | `promotion.updated` | `HandlePromotionUpdated` | ✅ Sync local discount mirror |
| `promotion.deleted` | `promotion.deleted` | `HandlePromotionDeleted` | ✅ Clean local discount mirror |
| **`promotion.deactivated`** | — | **NOT SUBSCRIBED** | ❌ **[V3-01]** Must subscribe to keep discount mirror consistent on campaign cascade |

**DLQ handling for pricing subscriptions**:
- `ConsumeStockUpdateDLQ` defined → ❌ NOT registered in `workers.go`
- `ConsumeLowStockDLQ` defined → ❌ NOT registered in `workers.go`
- `ConsumePromoDLQ` defined → ❌ NOT registered in `workers.go`

All 3 DLQ drain handlers are dead code (see [V2-03]).

### 4.2 Promotion Service Subscriptions

| Event | Handler | Needed? |
|-------|---------|---------| 
| `orders.order.status_changed` | `OrderConsumer.ConsumeOrderStatusChanged` | ✅ Confirm/release usage on order status |

**DLQ handling**:
- No DLQ consumer for `orders.order.status_changed.dlq` — see [V2-07].

---

## 5. New Issues Found in This Audit (v3)

### 🔴 V3-01: Pricing Does NOT Subscribe to `promotion.deactivated` — Stale Discount Mirror on Campaign Cascade

**File**: `pricing/internal/data/eventbus/promo_consumer.go`, `promotion/internal/biz/campaign.go:83–101`

**Problem**: When a campaign is deactivated, `DeactivateCampaign` cascades to all child promotions and emits `promotion.deactivated` events via outbox for each. However, the pricing service's `PromoConsumer.ConsumePromoEvents` only subscribes to 3 topics:
- `promotion.created` → `HandlePromotionCreated`
- `promotion.updated` → `HandlePromotionUpdated`  
- `promotion.deleted` → `HandlePromotionDeleted`

The `promotion.deactivated` topic is **not subscribed**. Consequence:
- Pricing's local discount mirror retains stale "active" promotions that were cascade-deactivated.
- Customers see discounts that should no longer apply.
- `CalculatePrice` applies phantom discounts from deactivated promotions.

**Fix**: Add `promotion.deactivated` subscription in `promo_consumer.go:ConsumePromoEvents`:
```go
if err := c.client.AddConsumerWithMetadata("promotion.deactivated", pubsub, map[string]string{
    "deadLetterTopic": "promotion.deactivated.dlq",
}, c.HandlePromotionDeleted); err != nil {
    return err
}
```
Also add this DLQ topic to `ConsumePromoDLQ`.

---

### 🟡 V3-03: `HandleLowStock` Has No Idempotency Guard — Duplicate Events Trigger Duplicate Pricing

**File**: `pricing/internal/data/eventbus/stock_consumer.go:145–167`

**Problem**: `HandleStockUpdate` has an in-memory idempotency guard via `processedEvents` sync.Map (even if imperfect). `HandleLowStock` has **no idempotency check at all** — not even in-memory. Every duplicate delivery of a `low_stock` event from Dapr triggers a full observer pipeline run, potentially applying dynamic pricing adjustments multiple times.

**Fix**: Add the same `processedEvents` dedup pattern to `HandleLowStock` (and ideally move to Redis-backed dedup for both handlers).

---

### 🟡 V3-04: Promotion Constants vs Outbox Topic Names Are Different — Maintenance Trap

**File**: `promotion/internal/constants/constants.go` vs `promotion/internal/biz/promotion_usecase.go`

**Problem**: Constants define topic names with `promotions.` prefix (e.g., `TopicPromotionCreated = "promotions.promotion.created"`), but the biz layer saves outbox events with bare names (e.g., `EventType: "promotion.created"`). These constants are **NOT used** for outbox event types — they're dangling. If a future developer uses `constants.TopicPromotionCreated` to subscribe or publish, they'll connect to a different topic than what the outbox actually emits.

| Where | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `constants.go:TopicPromotionCreated` | `"promotions.promotion.created"` |
| `promotion_usecase.go:23` (actual outbox) | `"promotion.created"` |
| Pricing subscribes to | `"promotion.created"` ✅ matches outbox |

**Fix**: Either (a) align constants to `"promotion.created"` etc., or (b) use the constants in `promotion_usecase.go` instead of hardcoded strings. Consistency is the key requirement.

---

### 🔵 V3-P2-03: Promotion Outbox Worker Missing `StopChan()` in Select Loop

**File**: `promotion/internal/worker/outbox_worker.go:49–56`

**Problem**: The `Start()` select loop only listens for `ctx.Done()`:
```go
select {
case <-ctx.Done():
    return nil
case <-ticker.C:
    w.processEvents(ctx)
}
```
It does NOT listen for `w.StopChan()`. Compare pricing's outbox worker which has both `ctx.Done()` AND `w.StopChan()`. If `BaseContinuousWorker.Stop()` is called without cancelling ctx, the promotion outbox worker will keep running.

**Fix**: Add `case <-w.StopChan(): return nil` to the select block.

## 6. Previously Identified Issues — Status Update

### 🔴 V2-03: Pricing — DLQ Drain Handlers NOT Registered in `workers.go`

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED this session** — Added `stockDLQWorker`, `lowStockDLQWorker`, `promoDLQWorker` types and registered in `NewWorkers()`. All 3 DLQ methods (`ConsumeStockUpdateDLQ`, `ConsumeLowStockDLQ`, `ConsumePromoDLQ`) are now wired.

### 🔴 V2-04: Pricing Worker `worker-deployment.yaml` Missing secretRef/volumeMounts

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** — `gitops/apps/pricing/base/worker-deployment.yaml` now has:
- `secretRef: pricing` (line 63–64)
- `volumeMounts` for `/app/configs` (lines 84–87)
- `volumes` with `configMap: pricing-config` (lines 89–92)

### 🔴 V2-05: Promotion Worker `worker-deployment.yaml` Missing secretRef/volumeMounts

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** — `gitops/apps/promotion/base/worker-deployment.yaml` now has:
- `secretRef: promotion-secrets` (line 63–64)
- `volumeMounts` for `/app/configs` (lines 72–74)
- `volumes` with `configMap: promotion-config` (lines 96–99)
- Bonus: `startupProbe` added (lines 89–95)

### 🟡 V2-06: Stock Consumer In-Memory Dedup Lost on Pod Restart

**Status**: ❌ **Still Open** — `stock_consumer.go:31–52` still uses `sync.Map`. Needs Redis `SET NX EX` migration (larger refactor).

### 🟡 V2-07: Promotion — No DLQ Consumer for `order.status_changed`

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED this session** — Added `ConsumeOrderStatusChangedDLQ` to `order_consumer.go` and registered in `event_worker.go:Start()`.
