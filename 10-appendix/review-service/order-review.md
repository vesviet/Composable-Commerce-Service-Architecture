## 🔍 Service Review: order

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Work 

### 📊 Issue Summary

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| P0 (Blocking) | 2 | Remaining |
| P1 (High) | 2 | Remaining |
| P2 (Normal) | 1 | Remaining |

### 🔴 P0 Issues (Blocking)
1. **[TESTING]** `order/internal/biz` — Unit Test coverage is critically low (20-30%). The entire Saga state machine logic, order placement, and cancellation workflows do not have adequate safety nets.
2. **[TESTING]** `order/internal/biz/mocks.go` — Mock structure entirely violates `testcase.md`. It uses a 700+ line manually written `MockOrderRepo` instead of leveraging `gomock` generated files. This causes massive technical debt when refactoring interfaces.

### 🟡 P1 Issues (High)
1. **[DATABASE PERFORMANCE]** `order/internal/data/postgres/order.go` — Massive N+1 query problem due to chains of `.Preload("Items").Preload("ShippingAddress").Preload("BillingAddress").Preload("StatusHistory").Preload("Payments").Preload("Shipments")`. When fetching lists of orders, this will crush the database. Needs refactoring to `.Joins()`.
2. **[TRACING]** `common/outbox/worker` & `order/events` — `Traceparent` is not injected into Outbox events generated by `order`. Thus, distributed tracing breaks between Order creation and downstream async processing.

### 🔵 P2 Issues (Normal)
1. **[CODE STYLE]** `order/README.md` — Ensure the README follows the standard layout and instructions.

### ✅ Completed Actions
1. Verified Saga Implementation: Order service correctly implements a durable Saga State pattern with dead-letter-queue (DLQ) support for compensation failures.
2. Verified Deployment Readiness (Ports align with GitOps standard: HTTP 8004 / gRPC 9004).

### 🌐 Cross-Service Impact
- Services that import this proto: `gateway`, `payment`, `fulfillment`, `shipping`.
- Services that consume events: `warehouse` (reserve stock), `payment` (charge card), `notification` (email receipt).
- Backward compatibility: ✅ Preserved.

### 🚀 Deployment Readiness
- Config/GitOps aligned: ✅ 
- Health probes: ✅ 
- Resource limits: ✅ 
- Migration safety: ✅ 

### Build Status
- `golangci-lint`: ❌ Minor warnings (tagliatelle, wsl)
- `go build -mod=mod ./...`: ✅ Success
- `wire`: ✅ Generated 
- Generated Files (`wire_gen.go`, `*.pb.go`): ✅ Not modified manually
- `bin/` Files: ✅ Removed 

### Documentation
- Service doc: ✅ 
- README.md: ⚠️ Needs standardization
- CHANGELOG.md: ❌ Missing or outdated
