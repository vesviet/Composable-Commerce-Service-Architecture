## Data Flow Validation

### 1. Product Data Flow
```
Client → API Gateway → Catalog Service → [Parallel calls to all services] → Aggregated response
```
**Validation**: ✅ Complete - All product-related data gathered in single orchestrated call

### 2. Cart to Order Flow
```
Add to Cart → Cart Management → Checkout Initiation → Payment Processing → Order Completion
```
**Validation**: ✅ Complete - Full customer journey covered with proper state management

### 3. Order to Delivery Flow
```
Order Created → Fulfillment Created → Warehouse Operations → Shipping → Delivery
```
**Validation**: ✅ Complete - Event-driven fulfillment with proper status tracking

## Error Handling Coverage

### Get Product Flow
