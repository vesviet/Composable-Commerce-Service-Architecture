# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & Context Mapping

Here are all docs relating to domain modeling, bounded contexts and (optionally) visual context maps.

## How to contribute:
- Document each domain or subdomain as `xxx-domain.md` (e.g., `order-domain.md`, `shipping-domain.md`)
- Maintain context map (visual: context-map.png or in PlantUML/Mermaid)
- Versioning: If context or boundary shift, increment version/date in filename.

## Conventions:
- Explain term, responsibilities, relationships.
- Always link to glossary for shared terminology.
