# Magento 2 to Microservices Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating from Magento 2 monolithic architecture to a microservices-based system. The migration will be executed in phases to minimize business disruption while ensuring data integrity and system reliability.

## Current State Analysis

### Magento 2 Monolithic Architecture
- Single codebase handling all e-commerce functions
- Tightly coupled modules
- Shared database architecture
- Limited scalability for individual components
- Deployment challenges for partial updates

### Target Microservices Architecture
- **12 core microservices** with clear boundaries
- **3-layer architecture** (Presentation, Application, Infrastructure)
- Event-driven communication with message bus
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity support
- Enhanced fault tolerance and observability

## Migration Strategy (Read-First, Write-Later Approach)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)
**Objective**: Establish microservices infrastructure and read-only services

#### Week 1-2: Infrastructure Setup
- Set up container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker)
- Configure service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- Implement API Gateway with routing capabilities
- Set up monitoring and logging (ELK Stack, Prometheus)
- Configure CI/CD pipelines
- **Data Replication Setup**: Configure real-time data sync from Magento DB

#### Week 3-4: Read-Only Core Services Development
- **Catalog Service**: Extract product catalog (READ-ONLY mode)
- **Customer Service**: Migrate customer management (READ-ONLY mode)
- **User Service**: Implement internal user management (READ-ONLY mode)
- **Auth Service**: Implement authentication and authorization
- **Notification Service**: Implement notification system
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data consistency between Magento and new services

### Phase 2: Read Services Validation & Inventory (Weeks 5-8)
**Objective**: Switch reads to new services and implement inventory management

#### Week 5-6: Switch Reads + Inventory Service
- **Switch Read Traffic**: Route read operations to new services via API Gateway
- **Dual Write Setup**: Write to both Magento and new services
- **Inventory & Warehouse Service**: Implement with dual-write pattern
- **Data Consistency Monitoring**: Real-time validation between systems
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to switch back to Magento reads if issues

#### Week 7-8: Pricing Service + Read Validation
- **Pricing Service**: Implement SKU + Warehouse pricing (READ-ONLY initially)
- **Read Performance Testing**: Validate new services handle production load
- **Data Drift Detection**: Monitor and fix any data inconsistencies
- **Pricing Validation**: Compare pricing calculations between old and new systems

### Phase 3: Write Migration Preparation (Weeks 9-12)
**Objective**: Prepare write operations and advanced features

#### Week 9-10: Order Service Preparation
- **Order Service**: Implement order processing logic (READ-ONLY mode)
- **Payment Service**: Implement payment gateway integration (READ-ONLY mode)
- **Write Logic Development**: Develop write operations but keep disabled
- **Transaction Validation**: Ensure ACID compliance across services
- **Rollback Procedures**: Comprehensive rollback plans for write operations

#### Week 11-12: Advanced Services + Write Testing
- **Promotion Service**: Implement with SKU + Warehouse configuration (READ-ONLY)
- **Shipping Service**: Implement fulfillment entity (READ-ONLY)
- **Search Service**: Set up Elasticsearch with real-time indexing
- **Review Service**: Implement review system (READ-ONLY)
- **Write Operation Testing**: Test write operations in staging environment

### Phase 4: Write Migration & Go-Live (Weeks 13-16)
**Objective**: Switch writes to new services and complete migration

#### Week 13-14: Gradual Write Migration
- **Event Bus**: Implement Kafka/RabbitMQ for async communication
- **Cache Layer**: Set up Redis for performance optimization
- **Gradual Write Switch**: Start with non-critical writes (reviews, preferences)
- **Critical Write Preparation**: Prepare for order and payment write migration
- **Monitoring Enhancement**: Real-time monitoring for write operations

#### Week 15-16: Complete Write Migration & Validation
- **Critical Write Switch**: Migrate order creation and payment processing
- **Inventory Write Switch**: Switch inventory updates to new services
- **End-to-end Testing**: Complete system testing with new write paths
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure system meets performance requirements
- **Magento Decommission**: Gradually reduce Magento dependencies

## Data Migration Strategy

### Database Decomposition
```
Magento 2 Database → Multiple Service Databases
├── catalog_* tables → Catalog Service DB
├── catalog_product_price_* tables → Pricing Service DB
├── salesrule_* tables → Promotion Service DB
├── cataloginventory_* tables → Warehouse Service DB
├── sales_* tables → Order Service DB
├── sales_payment_* tables → Payment Service DB
├── shipping_* tables → Shipping Service DB
├── customer_* tables → Customer Service DB
├── review_* tables → Review Service DB
├── admin_user_* tables → User Service DB
├── admin_role_* tables → User Service DB
├── authorization_* tables → Auth Service DB
├── search_* tables → Search Service DB
└── core_email_* tables → Notification Service DB
├── customer_* tables → Customer Service DB
├── review_* tables → Review Service DB
├── admin_user_* tables → Auth Service DB
├── search_* tables → Search Service DB
└── core_email_* tables → Notification Service DB
```

### Migration Approach
1. **Dual Write Pattern**: Write to both old and new systems during transition
2. **Event Sourcing**: Capture all changes as events for replay capability
3. **Data Validation**: Continuous validation between old and new systems
4. **Rollback Strategy**: Ability to revert to Magento 2 if needed

## Technical Implementation

### Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for real-time operations
- **Asynchronous**: Event streaming (Apache Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- **Data Consistency**: Saga pattern for distributed transactions

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js/Java/Python (service-specific)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **API Gateway**: Kong/AWS API Gateway
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Security Considerations
- OAuth 2.0/JWT for service authentication
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance for customer data

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Consistency**: Implement eventual consistency patterns
2. **Performance**: Extensive load testing and optimization
3. **Integration Complexity**: Phased rollout with feature flags
4. **Business Continuity**: Blue-green deployment strategy

### Rollback Plan
- Maintain Magento 2 system in parallel during migration
- Feature flags to switch between old and new systems
- Data synchronization mechanisms for quick rollback
- Automated rollback triggers based on error rates

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- System availability > 99.9%
- Order processing time reduction by 50%
- Deployment frequency increase by 10x

### Business Metrics
- Zero data loss during migration
- < 1 hour downtime during cutover
- Customer experience parity or improvement
- Developer productivity increase by 30%

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 4 weeks | Infrastructure + 3 core services |
| Phase 2 | 4 weeks | Order & Inventory services |
| Phase 3 | 4 weeks | Promotion & Shipping services |
| Phase 4 | 4 weeks | Integration & Go-live |
| **Total** | **16 weeks** | **Complete migration** |
