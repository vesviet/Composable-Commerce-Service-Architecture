# 📋 Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**Purpose**: Document major architectural and technical decisions  
**Format**: One ADR per decision with context, rationale, and consequences  
**Navigation**: [← Back to Main](../README.md) | [Architecture →](../01-architecture/README.md)

## 📖 What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant architectural and technical decisions made during the development of the microservices platform. Each ADR captures:

- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs, benefits, and risks
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered and why they were rejected

## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

### Core Technology Choices

1. **Language & Framework**: Go 1.25.3 + go-kratos v2
2. **Architecture Pattern**: Event-driven microservices
3. **Communication**: Dapr Pub/Sub with Redis Streams
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL per service + Redis for caching
5. **Service Discovery**: Consul
6. **Container Platform**: Docker + Kubernetes
7. **GitOps**: ArgoCD with Kustomize
8. **CI/CD**: GitLab CI with reusable templates
9. **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger
10. **API Design**: gRPC + REST (dual protocol)

### Design Principles

- **Event-First**: Events as first-class citizens
- **Database Per Service**: Data isolation and autonomy
- **GitOps**: Git as single source of truth
- **Configuration as Code**: Declarative configuration
- **Observability Built-in**: Metrics, logs, traces from day one

## 📝 How to Create a New ADR

### Step 1: Copy Template
```bash
cp docs/08-architecture-decisions/ADR-template.md \
   docs/08-architecture-decisions/ADR-XXX-your-decision.md
```

### Step 2: Fill Required Sections

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title of Decision

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Deciders:** Team names

## Context
Why is this decision needed? What problems are we solving?

## Decision
What are we deciding? What solution did we choose?

## Consequences
What are the trade-offs, benefits, and risks?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we evaluate and why were they rejected?

## Implementation Guidelines
How should this decision be implemented?

## References
Links to relevant documentation and resources
```

### Step 3: Review Process

1. **Draft**: Create ADR with status "Proposed"
2. **Review**: Share with relevant teams for feedback
3. **Discussion**: Address concerns and questions
4. **Approval**: Get sign-off from principal engineer(s)
5. **Accept**: Update status to "Accepted" and merge
6. **Update Index**: Add to this README.md

### Step 4: Peer Review Requirements

- ✅ At least 1 principal engineer approval
- ✅ Relevant team leads consulted
- ✅ Security review (if applicable)
- ✅ Performance implications considered
- ✅ Cost implications documented

## 🔄 ADR Lifecycle

### Status Values

- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision made and approved
- **Rejected**: Considered but not chosen
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- ✅ **Architecture Patterns**: Microservices, event-driven, CQRS
- ✅ **Technology Selection**: Languages, frameworks, databases
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, cloud providers, networking
- ✅ **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- ✅ **Performance**: Caching strategies, optimization approaches
- ✅ **Integration**: API design, communication patterns
- ✅ **Development**: Build tools, testing strategies, workflows

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create ADRs for:

- ❌ **Implementation Details**: Code-level decisions
- ❌ **Temporary Solutions**: Short-term workarounds
- ❌ **Obvious Choices**: Industry-standard practices
- ❌ **Reversible Decisions**: Easy to change later

## 📚 ADR Best Practices

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Be Concise**: Keep ADRs focused and readable
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why the decision was needed
3. **Document Alternatives**: Show what else was considered
4. **Include Trade-offs**: Be honest about consequences
5. **Add References**: Link to relevant documentation
6. **Use Examples**: Provide concrete examples where helpful

### Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Keep Updated**: Update ADRs when circumstances change
2. **Link Related ADRs**: Reference related decisions
3. **Supersede When Needed**: Create new ADR to replace old ones
4. **Archive Deprecated**: Mark old ADRs as superseded
5. **Review Regularly**: Quarterly review of all ADRs
