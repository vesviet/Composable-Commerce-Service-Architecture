# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Major architectural/technical decisions go here. Each file = one decision (example: ADR-001-ddd-architecture.md).

## How to add a new ADR
1. Copy `ADR-template.md` in this directory for new decision.
2. Fill all sections: Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives.
3. Date and number each ADR (e.g., ADR-002-sso-provider.md).
4. Peer review mandatory! (At least 1 principal engineer.)

## Template
See `ADR-template.md` for minimal skeleton.
