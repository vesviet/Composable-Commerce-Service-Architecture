## üöÄ Cloud-Native Benefits

### **Event-Driven Architecture**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Service A] -->|Event| B[Event Bus]
    B --> C[Service B]
    B --> D[Service C]
    B --> E[Service D]
```
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via events
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't cascade
- **Scalability**: Event bus handles traffic spikes

### **Service Mesh Integration**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Service Mesh (Consul Connect)"
        A[Service A] <--> B[Service B]
        B <--> C[Service C]
        A <--> C
    end
    
    subgraph "Platform Layer"
        SM[Service Mesh]
        SD[Service Discovery]
        SEC[Security/mTLS]
    end
```
- **Security**: Automatic mTLS between services
- **Observability**: Traffic monitoring and tracing
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers and retries

### **Observability Stack**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Applications"
        APP1[Service 1]
        APP2[Service 2]
        APP3[Service 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Observability Layer"
        METRICS[Prometheus<br/>Metrics]
        LOGS[ELK Stack<br/>Logs]
        TRACES[Jaeger<br/>Traces]
        DASH[Grafana<br/>Dashboards]
    end
    
    APP1 --> METRICS
    APP1 --> LOGS
    APP1 --> TRACES
    APP2 --> METRICS
    APP2 --> LOGS
    APP2 --> TRACES
    APP3 --> METRICS
    APP3 --> LOGS
    APP3 --> TRACES
    
    METRICS --> DASH
    LOGS --> DASH
    TRACES --> DASH
```

## üìà Scalability Patterns

### **Horizontal Scaling**
```yaml
Layer 1 (Presentation):
  - API Gateway: 3+ instances behind load balancer
  - Frontend: CDN distribution globally

Layer 2 (Application):
  - Each service: 2-10 instances based on load
  - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory/custom metrics

Layer 3 (Infrastructure):
  - Auth Service: 3+ instances for high availability
  - Search Service: Elasticsearch cluster

Layer 4 (Platform):
  - Redis: Cluster mode with sharding
  - Consul: 3-5 node cluster
  - Monitoring: Distributed across nodes
```

### **Vertical Scaling**

Resource Allocation by Layer:
  Layer 1: CPU-optimized (request handling)
  Layer 2: Balanced (business logic processing)
  Layer 3: Memory-optimized (search, caching)
  Layer 4: I/O-optimized (storage, messaging)
```

Phase 3: Migrate Layer 2 (Application services)
Phase 4: Optimize Layer 1 (Presentation layer)
```

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Layer Independence**: Failure in one layer doesn't affect others
- **Gradual Migration**: Migrate one layer at a time
