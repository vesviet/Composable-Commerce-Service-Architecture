# Magento 2 to Microservices Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating from Magento 2 monolithic architecture to a microservices-based system. The migration will be executed in phases to minimize business disruption while ensuring data integrity and system reliability.

## Current State Analysis

### Migration Approach (Zero-Downtime Strategy)

#### 1. Read-First Migration Pattern
```
Phase 1: Infrastructure + Read-Only Services
Phase 2: Switch Reads + Dual Write Setup  
Phase 3: Write Logic Development + Validation
Phase 4: Gradual Write Migration + Complete Switch
```

#### 2. Data Consistency Strategy
- **Real-time Replication**: Continuous data sync from Magento to new services
- **Dual Write Pattern**: Write to both systems during transition period
- **Data Validation**: Continuous comparison and drift detection
- **Event Sourcing**: Capture all changes as events for replay capability

#### 3. Traffic Routing Strategy
```
Week 1-4:  All traffic → Magento 2
Week 5-8:  Reads → New Services, Writes → Magento 2 (+ dual write)
Week 9-12: Reads → New Services, Writes → Magento 2 (+ write validation)
Week 13-16: Reads → New Services, Writes → New Services (gradual)
```

#### 4. Rollback Strategy
- **Instant Read Rollback**: Switch reads back to Magento via API Gateway
- **Write Rollback**: Disable dual writes and route back to Magento
- **Data Recovery**: Event replay capability for data consistency
- **Health Checks**: Automated rollback triggers based on error rates

## Technical Implementation

### Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for real-time operations
- **Asynchronous**: Event streaming (Apache Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- **Data Consistency**: Saga pattern for distributed transactions

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js/Java/Python (service-specific)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **API Gateway**: Kong/AWS API Gateway
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Security Considerations
- OAuth 2.0/JWT for service authentication
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance for customer data
